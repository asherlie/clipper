clipper is meant to run on the adafruit metro express m0 with circuitpython

clipper allows users to copy infrared patterns from remote controls
and play them back

the rightmost button puts clipper into record mode

the leftmost button sends all recorded patterns

pressing play while in record mode deletes all recorded patterns

TODO:
      third button should be added to switch between pattern to send, as of now all are sent at once
      possibly limit number of patterns to 2^2, two LEDs should indicate which pattern we are on in binary
